## Leetcode
This is a repository where I will be saving my solutions to the problems I solve on Leetcode. 
I aim to solve the daily challenge everyday and also solve other problems as well.

### Languages
As I start this repository, I will be using Python and Javascript to solve the problems. As I get more comfortable solving leetcode problems, I will start using using C++ and Java as well.
Note: with python submissions, the leetcode runtime and memory usage varies drastically. One solution may can get a 5% time submission and at the same time an 80% time submission.

### Structure
The structure of the repository is as follows:
```
├── Daily Challenges
│   ├── 2023
│   │   ├── June
│   │   │   ├── day_one.py

├── Other Problems
│   ├── expressive_words.py
```

### Disclaimer
The solutions provided here are not the only solutions to the problems. There are many other ways to solve the problems. The solutions provided here are the ones I came up with. I will try to provide the time and space complexity of the solutions as well.
My solutions may not be the most optimal solutions. I will try to improve them as I learn more about the problems and the languages I am using.
